# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:

Task.create([{ name: 'laundry', details: 'make it fast', completed: false }
Task.create([{ name: 'code', details: 'active record', completed: false }
Task.create([{ name: 'running', details: 'Marathon', completed: false }
